If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP taskP/circle_pixel1__0 multiplier stage taskP/circle_pixel1__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net taskR/disp/oled_frame_begin is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin taskR/disp/r_offset_zero[7]_i_1/O, cell taskR/disp/r_offset_zero[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT taskR/disp/r_offset_zero[7]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 16 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    taskR/c_offset_seven_reg[0] {FDCE}
    taskR/c_offset_seven_reg[1] {FDCE}
    taskR/c_offset_seven_reg[2] {FDCE}
    taskR/c_offset_seven_reg[3] {FDCE}
    taskR/c_offset_seven_reg[4] {FDCE}
    taskR/c_offset_seven_reg[5] {FDCE}
    taskR/c_offset_seven_reg[6] {FDCE}
    taskR/c_offset_seven_reg[7] {FDCE}
    taskR/r_offset_zero_reg[0] {FDCE}
